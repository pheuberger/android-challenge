# Android code challenge

## Description
The goal of this challenge is to query the [giphy random roulette
API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#sticker-roulette-random-endpoint) and
display the fetched image. How you structure the UI is totally up to you.

## Constraints
* Frameworks: RxJava and Android Data binding.
* Don't use `flatMap` when transforming Observables. Try to find an
  alternative.

If you have any questions or problems drop me a message and I'll try to help you.

## Notes
Code readability is key in FRP, so please structure your code in a way other
people can understand what's going on easily.
